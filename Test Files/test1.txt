Once upon a time a guy named Juan took his OS and Networking
class and had this homework he had to recreate the wc program
written in C code, this guy Juan decided to create his own test
files, thats why he's writing this!
Juan went way too far since he could download the files from any webpage or maybe
just use some example files, but no, Juan is not like that, he went all in with the creation of the example texts in order to see
if his program ran correctly.
Lets wish Juan the best of luck!
The End.
